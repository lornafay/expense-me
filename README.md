# expense-me
A work-in-progress personal expense tracking application, currently in creation following along Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course at https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25595990?start=0#overview. The ReactJS code itself is not mine, it was merely a learning resource for the React framework. I plan to add a back-end API in future to handle user login.

This project is primarily intended as a personal exploration of Kubernetes.
To run the project as a cluster, cd to the K8S directory and run
`./deploy.sh`
to initiate a deployment that is served by a load balancer.

To run the project using Docker, use `docker-compose up` from the root directory.
